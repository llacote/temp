"""
HTTP client for the Agent AI service: planning + execution of approved
actions (see ARCHITECTURE.md "Décision structurante n°2").

ASSUMPTION, NOT YET CONFIRMED: the request/response shapes below are what
this backend expects. They have not been checked against Hugo's actual
Agent AI implementation. Treat this file as a proposed contract, not a
verified integration -- align it with the real Agent AI endpoints before
relying on it end to end.

Assumed contract:
  POST {AGENT_AI_URL}/plan
    request:  {"prompt": str}
    response: {"actions": [{"tool": str, "params": dict, "summary": str}, ...]}

  POST {AGENT_AI_URL}/execute
    request:  {"actions": [{"action_id": str, "tool": str, "params": dict}, ...]}
    response: {"results": [
        {"action_id": str, "status": "executed", "result": dict | None, "note": str | None},
        ...
    ]}

# ping_llm() specifically waits on a real LLM round trip (agent -> Ollama),

# OLLAMA_API_BASE client in ping-llm). This timeout MUST stay comfortably
# above that, or the backend gives up on the agent before the agent gives
# up on Ollama.
#
# In practice ping_llm() also needs enough RAM for Ollama to actually load
# a model, which turned out not to be a given (OOM-killed even on the
# smallest qwen3 tag, on a 3GB-constrained environment) -- that failure
# mode is independent of this codebase and outside what a longer timeout
# can fix. ping() below exists specifically to decouple "is the agent
# reachable" (what palier 2 needs) from "can this machine run an LLM right
# now" (a separate, later concern).
